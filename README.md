This project applies the concept of Modern Portfolio Theory (Markowitz Efficient Frontier) to analyze diversification benefits by constructing a two-asset portfolio consisting of the NIFTY FMCG Index and Sun Pharma stock using one year of daily data. Daily returns were calculated and different portfolio weights were assigned to compute portfolio return, variance, standard deviation, and covariance-correlation between assets. The results were visualized through the Markowitz Efficient Frontier, which shows the trade-off between risk and return and highlights how diversification reduces portfolio risk compared to holding a single asset. All calculations and visualizations were carried out in Excel.
